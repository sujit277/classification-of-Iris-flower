MODELS AND TERMS USED IN THIS PROJECT


# KNN Model -                   K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the simplest algorithms used in Machine Learning for regression and classification problem. KNN algorithms                                   use data and classify new data points based on similarity measures (e.g. distance function). Classification is done by a majority vote to its                                     neighbors. The data is assigned to the class which has the nearest neighbors. As you increase the number of nearest neighbors, the value of k,                                   accuracy might increase.


# Logistic Regression -       Logistic regression models the probabilities for classification problems with two possible outcomes.It's an extension of the linear regression                                   model for classification problems.the linear regression model can work well for regression, but fails for classification.  In case of two classes,                               you could label one of the classes with 0 and the other with 1 and use linear regression.Technically it works and most linear model programs will                                 spit out weights for us.



# Naive Bayes Algorithm - Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem. It is not a  single algorithm but a family of algorithms                           where all of them share a common principle i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other. The dataset is divided into two parts,                                 namely, feature matrix and the response vector.

                          Feature matrix contains all the vectors(rows) of dataset in which each vector consists of the value of dependent features.Response vector contains the                           value of class variable(prediction or output) for each row of feature matrix. 

# Decesion Tree Classifier - Decision tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning. They can be used to solve both regression and classification problems.                                  Decision tree uses the tree representation to solve the problem in which each leaf node corresponds to a class label and attributes are represented                              on the internal node of the tree. We can represent any boolean function on discrete attributes using the decision tree.
                                           Folowing Assumptions  are Taken--
                                           (1) At the beginning, we consider the whole training set as the root.
                                           (2) Feature values are preferred to be categorical. If the values are continuous then they are                                                                                        discretized prior to building the model.
                                           (3) On the basis of attribute values records are distributed recursively.
                                           (4) We use statistical methods for ordering attributes as root or the internal node
